<br>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br>

<br>All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>

<br>And the mome raths outgrabe.<br>

<br>"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>

<br>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>

<br>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>

<br>The frumious Bandersnatch!"<br>

<br>He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br>

<br>Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”<br>

<br>So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br>

<br>And stood awhile in thought.<br>

<br>And as in uffish thought he stood,<br>

<br>The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>

<br>Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>

<br>And burbled as it came!<br>

<br>One, two! One, two! and through and through<br>

<br>The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>

<br>He left it dead, and with its head<br>

<br>He went galumphing back.<br>

<br>"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>

<br>Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>

<br>O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"<br>

<br>He chortled in his joy.<br>

<br>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>

<br>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br>

<br>All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>

              <br>And the mome raths outgrabe.<br> </center></p>
